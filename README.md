*As part of my SQL internship project, I worked on analyzing a database using different SQL queries, mainly focusing on JOINs. The database had three connected tables: student_details, courses, and city, which were linked through IDs like crid and cid. The goal of the project was to get useful information by combining data from these tables using various types of JOINs such as INNER JOIN, LEFT JOIN, RIGHT JOIN, and CROSS JOIN. INNER JOIN helped me show students along with their course and city. LEFT JOIN was used to show all students, even those who were not assigned any course. RIGHT JOIN displayed all courses, including the ones that had no students enrolled. To show all possible combinations of cities and courses, I used CROSS JOIN. I also used ORDER BY to sort the records based on age and name, which made the results easy to read and understand. *
